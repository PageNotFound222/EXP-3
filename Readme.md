### THEORY
In C++, operators are special symbols that tell the compiler to perform certain operations—like math, logic, or comparisons. The language includes a variety of built-in operators such as arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators.

Arithmetic & Relational Operators:
Arithmetic operators handle basic math operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Relational operators are used to compare values—for example, to check if one number is greater than another. They return true or false, which is useful in decision-making.

Logical & Bitwise Operators:
Logical operators are used to combine or invert boolean conditions, which helps control how a program behaves based on multiple checks. Bitwise operators, on the other hand, work at the bit level and are more common in low-level tasks like graphics or encryption.

Assignment Operators:
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Whether you're giving a variable a new value or updating it using a mathematical operation, assignment operators make it easier to manage and manipulate data in your program.

Implementation Summary:
In this practical, I applied different types of operators in a few simple programs. These include checking if a number is positive or negative, assigning student grades based on average marks, and determining the quadrant of a coordinate. It was a helpful way to understand how operators work together in real scenarios.

### EXPERIMENT 3A
CHECKING WHEATHER THE NUMBER IS POSITIVE OR NOT:
This program checks whether a number entered by the user is positive, negative, or zero using simple conditional (if-else) statements. It compares the input number with zero and prints the appropriate result. This helps understand how condition checking works in C++ and is a basic example of decision-making in programming.
### EXPERIMENT 3B
In this program, the user inputs marks for three subjects. The program calculates the average and then determines the grade based on predefined ranges (e.g., 90+ = 'O', 80–89 = 'A+', etc.). This demonstrates how to use arithmetic and logical operators together with nested if-else statements to implement real-life decision logic in code.
### EXPERIMENT 3C
This program takes the x and y coordinates as input and uses conditional checks to find whether the point lies on the X-axis, Y-axis, origin, or in one of the four quadrants. It's a great example of combining multiple conditions to handle a variety of possible outcomes using if-else and logical operators.
